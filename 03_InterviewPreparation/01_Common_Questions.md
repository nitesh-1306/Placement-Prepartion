# Common Interview Questions

## Can you tell me a little about yourself?
- Thank you for having me today. I am Nitesh, and I'm currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Savitribai Phule Pune University. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a strong foundation in programming languages like C++, Python, and Dart, as well as database management. I had the opportunity to gain practical experience during an internship at CoRider, a startup, where I worked on user authentication and KYC registration in the backend using Flask as the framework. I have worked on various projects such as Diet Recommender, Ai Assistant using ESP32, and much more. One notable project I have worked on was Movie Recommender, which involved Flask as the main backend framework, which further enhanced my skills in backend development. I'm excited about the opportunity to be a python developer, and I believe my experiences align well with the challenges and goals of the role. Thank you.
