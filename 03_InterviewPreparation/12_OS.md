# Operating Systems Interview Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Fundamental Operating System Concepts

### 1.1 What is an Operating System?
An Operating System (OS) is a software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user.

### 1.2 Primary Functions of an Operating System
1. Resource Management
2. Process Management
3. Memory Management
4. File System Management
5. Device Management
6. Security and Access Control
7. User Interface Provision

## 2. Process Management

### 2.1 Process States
1. **New**: Process is being created
2. **Ready**: Process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
3. **Running**: Instructions are being executed
4. **Waiting**: Process waiting for some event or I/O operation
5. **Terminated**: Process execution is complete

### 2.2 Process Scheduling Algorithms
1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
   - Simple scheduling
   - Non-preemptive
   - Can cause long waiting times

2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
   - Minimizes average waiting time
   - Can cause starvation of long processes

3. **Round Robin**
   - Preemptive scheduling
   - Time quantum based
   - Prevents process starvation

4. **Priority Scheduling**
   - Assigns priority to each process
   - Can be preemptive or non-preemptive

### 2.3 Context Switching
- Process of storing the state of a preempted process
- Overhead involved in switching between processes

## 3. Memory Management

### 3.1 Memory Allocation Techniques
1. **Contiguous Memory Allocation**
   - Entire process allocated in a single continuous block

2. **Non-Contiguous Memory Allocation**
   - Process can be spread across different memory locations

### 3.2 Memory Allocation Strategies
1. **First Fit**
   - Allocates first available memory block

2. **Best Fit**
   - Finds smallest suitable memory block

3. **Worst Fit**
   - Allocates largest available memory block

### 3.3 Virtual Memory
- Separates logical memory from physical memory
- Allows execution of processes larger than physical memory
- Uses paging and segmentation

### 3.4 Paging
- Divides memory into fixed-size blocks
- Eliminates external fragmentation
- Supports non-contiguous memory allocation

## 4. Process Synchronization

### 4.1 Critical Section Problem
- Synchronization mechanism to prevent race conditions
- Mutual Exclusion
- Progress
- Bounded Waiting

### 4.2 Synchronization Mechanisms
1. **Mutex**
   - Mutual Exclusion Lock
   - Ensures only one thread accesses a resource

2. **Semaphores**
   - Synchronization primitive
   - Can allow multiple threads access

3. **Monitors**
   - High-level synchronization construct
   - Provides mutual exclusion

### 4.3 Deadlock
- Situation where processes are unable to proceed
- **Conditions for Deadlock:**
  1. Mutual Exclusion
  2. Hold and Wait
  3. No Preemption
  4. Circular Wait

#### Deadlock Handling Strategies
1. Deadlock Prevention
2. Deadlock Avoidance
3. Deadlock Detection and Recovery

## 5. File System Management

### 5.1 File System Types
1. FAT (File Allocation Table)
2. NTFS (New Technology File System)
3. ext4 (Linux)
4. APFS (Apple File System)

### 5.2 File System Operations
- File Creation
- File Deletion
- Reading
- Writing
- Searching

### 5.3 File Allocation Methods
1. Contiguous Allocation
2. Linked Allocation
3. Indexed Allocation

## 6. I/O Management

### 6.1 I/O Scheduling Algorithms
1. **FCFS (First Come First Served)**
2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**
3. **SCAN**
4. **C-SCAN**

### 6.2 Disk Management
- Disk Scheduling
- Disk Partitioning
- Disk Formatting

## 7. Security and Protection

### 7.1 Authentication Mechanisms
1. Password-based
2. Biometric
3. Two-Factor Authentication

### 7.2 Access Control
1. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
2. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## 8. Types of Operating Systems

### 8.1 Classification
1. **Batch Operating Systems**
2. **Time-Sharing Operating Systems**
3. **Distributed Operating Systems**
4. **Real-Time Operating Systems**
5. **Network Operating Systems**
