# Flask-RESTful Overview

## What is Flask-RESTful?

Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that simplifies the process of building REST APIs. It provides abstractions for defining resources, handling request parsing, and more.

## Key Concepts

- **Resource:** Represents an entity or concept in the API.
- **API:** A set of rules and tools for building software applications.

## Types of Authentication

### Session-Based Authentication

In session-based authentication, the server stores user information and issues a session identifier (usually a cookie) to the client.

#### Pros:

- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement.
- **Stateful:** Server maintains user state.

#### Cons:

- **Scalability:** Increased server load.
- **Mobile Apps:** Inconvenient for stateless clients.

### Token-Based Authentication

In token-based authentication, the server issues a token (e.g., JWT) to the client upon successful authentication, which the client includes in subsequent requests.

#### Pros:

- **Stateless:** No need to store session info on the server.
- **Scalability:** Suitable for distributed systems.
- **Mobile Apps:** Convenient for stateless clients.

#### Cons:

- **Token Management:** Requires proper token management.
- **Overhead:** Token must be included in each request.

## Flask-RESTful and Authentication

Flask-RESTful itself doesn't enforce a specific authentication method. It provides hooks and decorators allowing integration with various authentication mechanisms.
This provides basic HTTP authentication for a resource. You can adapt this for other authentication mechanisms like JWT.
