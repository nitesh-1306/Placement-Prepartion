# Useful Notes to follow

- Use "float('inf')" for any variables with max value, use -inf for any min.
- Use arr.copy() in functions, as any changes when passed in function are direct to original array.
- .sort() and .reverse() does not return anything
- Using = for declaration like "v1 = v2 = 1", both v1 and v2 points towards same memory location.
- Dividing will return float and not int, instead of / use // for int
- Sets store elements unique but in random order and no index
- string cant be split into a list, use '[chr for chr in str]' for it
- check out all substrings and all subsequences (2^n possible for a str)
