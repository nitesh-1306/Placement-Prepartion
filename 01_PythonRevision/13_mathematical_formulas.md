# Formulas for Coding Tests

## Mathematics

- Pythagorean theorem: $c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
- Area of a circle: $A = \pi r^2$
- Perimeter/Circumference of a circle: $P = 2\pi r$
- Area of a triangle: $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$
- Perimeter of a rectangle: $P = 2(l + w)$
- Volume of a cube: $V = s^3$
- Volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$

## Algebra

- Quadratic formula: $x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}}$
- Arithmetic progression sum: $S = \frac{{n(2a + (n-1)d)}}{2}$
- Geometric progression sum: $S = \frac{{a(1 - r^n)}}{{1 - r}}$


## Probability and Statistics

- Mean (Average): $\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$
- Median: Middle value in a sorted list of numbers.
- Mode: Most frequently occurring value in a dataset.
- Standard deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2}{n}}$

## Combinatorics

- Permutations: $P(n, k) = \frac{{n!}}{{(n - k)!}}$
- Combinations: $C(n, k) = \frac{{n!}}{{k! (n - k)!}}$

## Relationship between LCD and GCD and LCM

- GCD (Greatest Common Divisor): The largest positive integer that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.

    - $\text{GCD}(a,b)≤\text{min}(a,b)$

- LCM (Least Common Multiple): The smallest positive integer that is divisible by two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.

    - $\text{LCM}(a,b)≥\text{max}(a,b)$

- HCF (Highest Common Factor): The highest factor that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder.

Let $a$ and $b$ be two integers. Then, the relationship between their LCD, GCD and HCF is given by:

$\text{LCD}(a, b) \times \text{GCD}(a, b) = |ab|$

$\text{HCF}(a, b) = \text{GCD(a, b)}$

Here, $\text{LCD}(a, b)$ represents the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$, $\text{GCD}(a, b)$ represents the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$, and $\text{HCF}(a, b)$ represents the highest common factor of $a$ and $b$.
